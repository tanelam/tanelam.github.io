I think programming is the closest thing to having super powers. Code is one of the most powerful driving forces shaping the world, so I can’t think of a better skill to learn.

I’ve loved puzzles and mathematics ever since I was a little girl, and I like that coding has a little bit of both. There’s something exiting about using logic and analytical thinking to build something out of nothing.

It’s so satisfying when you finally solve a coding problem after you’ve been struggling with it for a while. I remember the first time that I played around with code. My husband was telling me about his experience with Codecademy and he challenged me to give it a go. I was supposed to just try it out, but wound up stuck to my computer long into the night. After that I got my subscription and kept playing around with code whenever I could.

A programmer can produce intelligent systems that can solve complex problems on their own. This translates into a very flexible career that allows you to work in many different fields. All of this coupled with the ever expanding landscape of technology, means that I can have a career full of interesting opportunities.
